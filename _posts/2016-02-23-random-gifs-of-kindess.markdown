I don't consider writing blog posts hard write. I like writing, but much like anyone else with a blog - I find doing it consistently to be difficult.
I'm *trying* to be better, and while pondering on the topic, I remember what I like about my Tumblr blog - It's fun to post random stuff I make. This is stuff that doesn't make it into my portfolio; or anywhere really. It's just random GIFs I like to make.

They are creative enterprises, and while not as corporate and dry and some blogs - why not have fun with mine and share what I enjoy creating: silly, silly GIFs.

Enjoy:
