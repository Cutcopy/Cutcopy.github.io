No matter how much you want it to be true, whiskey will never be your friend. Abusive boyfriend maybe, but never your friend.

Are we currently in a buyer’s or seller’s market? This is the question on everyone’s mind, and today we’ll answer it. It’s a pretty balanced market right now, but in most areas seller’s have a slight advantage. This time of year, inventory is typically quite low, so what we’re seeing now is pretty normal. You can expect to see more listings pop up in the early spring months. “ Our market is pretty balanced for now, but we’re unsure how much longer it will last. ” When inventory is low, home prices don’t fall. Right now, they are pretty stable in our area, which is good news for buyers. Also, interest rates are still quite low despite a slight hike in December. This is great for buyers looking to make their dollar go further! Whether you’re buying or selling, there are a lot of great opportunities in our current market. Conditions aren’t always this steady, and we may see some changes for the worse if interest rates rise like they’re expected to. In short, now is a great time to make a move! If you have any questions about our current market, or if you would like real estate assistance of any kind, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: def print_hi(name) puts "Hi, #{name}" end print_hi('Tom') #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT. Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk.

Killer Croc Just Can’t Stop. Stop till he drops. no no no. You’ll find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve --watch, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext and includes the necessary front matter.
